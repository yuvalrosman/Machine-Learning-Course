# Machine Learning Course - README

Welcome to the Machine Learning course! This course provided a comprehensive introduction to fundamental concepts and techniques in Machine Learning. Below is an overview of the course and the four assignments completed during the term.

## Course Overview

This course covers a range of topics in Machine Learning, from basic linear models to more complex decision-making algorithms. Students gain hands-on experience through a series of assignments designed to reinforce theoretical concepts with practical applications.

## Assignments

### 1. Linear Least Squares (LLS)
**Objective:** Understand and implement Linear Least Squares for regression.
**Description:** This assignment focused on fitting a linear model to a dataset by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed and predicted values.

### 2. Decision Trees
**Objective:** Learn about decision trees for classification and regression tasks.
**Description:** In this assignment, we explored the construction of decision trees, including the concepts of information gain and pruning to prevent overfitting.

### 3. Probability Estimation
**Objective:** Estimate probabilities for different classes in a dataset.
**Description:** This assignment involved techniques for estimating the probability distribution of data points across various classes, using methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian Estimation.

### 4. Classification
**Objective:** Implement and evaluate different classification algorithms.
**Description:** The final assignment covered various classification techniques, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and support vector machines (SVMs). We compared their performance on different datasets.

## Conclusion

This course provided a solid foundation in Machine Learning, with practical assignments that reinforced key concepts. The skills and knowledge gained from this course are essential for further studies and applications in the field of Machine Learning.
